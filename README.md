## Zustand and React Query Demo

This this uses `zustand` and `react-query` to simulate an app with both global state, and external requests caching and management via `react-query` (basic usage)

The app simulate HTTP request by using a Promise with `setTimeout`. For a real app it is recommended to use `axios` for server communication.

To run the project locally, fetch the project and execute the following command:

```bash
$ yarn install
$ yarn dev

```

### More info

The app uses TailwindCSS for management of styling
